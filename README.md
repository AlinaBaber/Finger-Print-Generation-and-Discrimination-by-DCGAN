# Fingerprint Generation and Authentication using ADCGAN

This project leverages **Adaptive Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (ADCGAN)** for generating and authenticating fingerprint images, crucial for applications like mobile security, biometrics, and airport systems.

## Overview

Fingerprints are unique and widely used for secure authentication. This project employs deep learning with ADCGAN to generate realistic fingerprints and authenticate them with a high degree of accuracy, achieving **92% authentication accuracy**.

## Key Features

- **Fingerprint Synthesis**: Generates realistic fingerprints using ADCGAN.
- **Fingerprint Authentication**: Authenticates fingerprints generated with ADCGAN.
- **High Accuracy**: 92% accuracy on the Socofing fingerprint dataset.
- **Application Areas**: Useful for secure access in mobile, biometric systems, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
